    title: "About Me"
    text: "Fascinated by all things strange"
    body: "It all began with a formal introduction to the dynamic ecoystem of marine invertebrates that occupy the Salish Sea in 2014. Since then, my scientific interests have focussed on applying the principles of molecular evolution, phylogenetics, and the coupling of experimental biology with bioinformatics to address questions about how genomes have evolved across the animal Kingdom."
